description: Railguard is a Claude Code hook that protects against secrets leakage, dangerous commands, and unauthorized tool use.

## What is Railguard?

Railguard is **The Firewall for Claude Code**. It sits between Claude and your system, inspecting every tool invocation before it executes.

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│  Claude Code │ ──► │  Railguard  │ ──► │  Tool Execution  │
│  (LLM)       │     │  (Inspect)  │     │  (Bash, Write..) │

                     Block or Allow
```

## Why Railguard?

### The Problem

Claude Code has powerful capabilities that can be dangerous if misused:
- Bash commands can leak secrets via curl, environment variables, or error messages
- File operations can expose `.env`, credentials, or private keys
- Network requests can exfiltrate data to unauthorized domains

### The Solution

Railguard performs inspection on every tool call:

1. **Check tool permissions** — Is this tool allowed, denied, or requires confirmation?
2. **Scan for secrets** — AWS keys, GitHub tokens, private keys, high-entropy strings
3. **Block dangerous commands** — `rm -rf /`, fork bombs, disk operations
4. **Protect sensitive paths** — `.ssh/`, `.env`, `*.pem`, credentials files
5. **Prevent exfiltration** — Block ngrok, pastebin, webhook.site

All with **< 1ms latency** and a **fail-closed** architecture.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Secret Detection** | Blocks AWS keys, GitHub tokens, OpenAI keys, private keys |
| **Dangerous Commands** | Prevents `rm -rf /`, fork bombs, disk writes |
| **Protected Paths** | Blocks access to `.ssh/`, `.aws/credentials`, `.env` |
| **Network Protection** | Blocks exfiltration to ngrok, pastebin, webhook.site |
| **Tool Permissions** | Allow/deny/ask rules for any tool or MCP server |
| **Sub-ms Latency** | Pre-compiled patterns, won't slow your workflow |

## Architecture

Railguard is a Rust Cargo workspace:

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `bin/rg` | CLI: hook execution, install/uninstall, lint, test |
| `rg-types` | Shared types: Config, Verdict, HookInput |
| `rg-policy` | Policy engine: secret scanning, command blocking |

## Who is Railguard for?

- **Developers** using Claude Code for daily work
- **Teams** wanting guardrails on AI-assisted development
- **Security-conscious** organizations with compliance requirements
